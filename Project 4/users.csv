<p>Hi, I'm in my senior year of studies towards a bachelor's in Computer Science. Though I enjoy learning regardless of subject, my primary interest lies in machine learning and data science. I love finding patterns in data and solving problems. For the past few years, I've worked on various machine learning problems in computer vision and natural language processing. Recently, I worked on an image captioning project, in which the deep learning model describes the content of the image. In my free time, I enjoy going through Q&amp;A on the StackExchange network.</p>

<p>Just Another Genome Hacker,</p>

<p>Sadly, my most voted-up answer on Stackoverflow (311 votes) belonged to a question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2420689/surprise-for-a-programmer-on-birthday/2421312#2421312"">that later got deleted.</a> The question came from a girl that asked for something cute that she could put on the icing of a birthday cake for her programmer boyfriend.</p>

<p>I suggested that, if her boyfriend is somewhat mathematically inclined, she write the following:</p>

<pre><code>    sin(t) √|cos(t)|
r = __________________  - 2 sin(t) + 2
    sin(t) + 7/5
</code></pre>

<p>If he doesn't get it at first, she could tease him with saying that it is obvious that he should take the polar plot of it. If he still doesn't get it, she should tell him to enter it in <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polar%20r=%28sin%28t%29*sqrt%28abs%28cos%28t%29%29%29%29/%28sin%28t%29%20%2b%207/5%29%20-2*sin%28t%29%20%2b%202"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WolframAlpha</a>, that should yield the result:</p>

I agree wholeheartedly with the following statement of support:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The recent actions of Stack Exchange have been reprehensible. The lack
  of professional conduct, the tone deaf way they've been dealing with
  the community, and the unfair and unjustified way they've dealt with
  Monica Cellio. Monica is an exemplar of the community, it's incredible
  how she's managed to keep a level head during this time when emotions
  have been very high. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/336526/187282"">REINSTATE

I love mathematics and anything concerning logical thinking. I'm interested mostly with machine learning projects.I believe if I have to make machines be able to learn, I have to be a good learner myself and that's what I am doing. Favorite programming languages are python, java, c and c++. I treasure friends and prefer learning new things over almost everything else.</p>

<p>Since joining the Software Engineering Major during my junior year of high school, I've participated in mobile app development projects and engineering internships geared toward building interactive user interfaces and web servers.</p>

<p>Recently, I have completed a full stack web developer internship for n-Tier Financial Solutions, a fintech startup based in New York City. There, I developed the front- and back-ends of Control Workbench, a data aggregation program used by some of the largest banks and financial institutions in the world.</p>

<p>On my own, I have been strengthening my skills in JavaScript interactive media programming using Angular 4 and Ionic 3, and am super excited to unveil a startup a peer and I have been working on for several months.</p>

<p>As an obsessive web and app developer, I'm always eager to work with other motivated programmers on great ideas that change the way people interact with technology!</p>

  <p>For every natural phenomenon there are different levels of
  explanation. I like to call these ""why"" values. For the first value of
  why, the question ""Why is the sky blue?"" can be answered with some
  simple hand-waving about light from the sun passing through our
  planet's atmosphere. For a value of why + 2 (also known to parents as,
  ""But whyyyyy?"") you have to start talking about the fact that light
  comes in different colors. </p>

<p>A popular and well-respected volunteer network moderator, Monica Cellio, <a href=""https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193"">was terminated without warning</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334133/187282"">portrayed to the press as misgendering trans people</a> by Stack Overflow, Inc. All signs suggest this was an erroneous, if not malicious, decision not founded on fact, for which the company is completely failing to take any responsibility. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/187282"">This has caused an enormous and ongoing uproar in the community.</a></p>

<p>Monica and the community have been quite literally <strong>begging</strong> for <em>some</em> kind of response from the company either opening up a path to reinstatement, or justifying their decision to terminate her, for more than a month now. She's made many good-faith offers to talk, and others have offered to mediate (and made <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=monica"">dozens of constructive suggestions on how to resolve the situation</a>). Members of the Lavender community have spoken up on her behalf (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/333992/187282"">1</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731/187282"">2</a>).</p>

<p>So far, Stack Overflow, Inc. has met all of this with thunderous silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good faith, I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate callousness of this behavior which we have to assume now is the new normal.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526/187282"">Having exhausted all other means of communication</a>, Monica is now raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name. This is in her own interest, but arguably also in the interest of the SE community at large. While only the libel is likely to be legally actionable, it might establish at least <em>some</em> boundaries on what the company can do to its volunteers, as well as be a symbolic wake up call for a business that appears to have lost all respect for the community that keeps it alive.</p>

<p>I have complete trust the funds will be used well and anything left over (e.g., if they eventually decide to do the right thing and legal action becomes unnecessary) will go donated to <a href=""https://www.thetrevorproject.org/about/programs-services/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Trevor Project</a>, an organization that provides crisis-intervention services to LGBTQ+ youth. </p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/stop-stack-overflow-from-defaming-its-users"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Consider supporting her today.</a></strong></p>

<p>October 30, 2019 I would encourage contributions to Monica's legal fund in excess of the stated goal of <span class=""math-container"">$10,000. A single motion could easily cost $</span>15,000. If it is SE Inc's strategy to just wait everyone out here, it will be very surprising if they don't take the same delay and exhaust tactic in a legal battle. </p>

<p>Hello!  Welcome to my profile!  I'm a computer science and statistics major working towards my bachelors degree.  I work a lot with with data science, programming (specifically C++ and R), algorithm selection, and statistical concepts. I'm a learner, so I plan on using this site to learn about stuff that I am shaky on, as well as helping out with questions that I am able to answer.  I try to make my answers straightforward and fun to read!  That's about it, so I hope you have a nice day!</p>

<p>I am a software developer with over 4 years experience working on medium to large project for companies and institutions .
As my display picture depicts ,  I am always behind the computer learning new technology and design principles to be very efficient in my field of work.</p>

<p>I was employed to my first job after a month of graduation. Some years later,  due to my diligent and professional work,  my pay was increased by 65%.  Three years later, due to some natural disasters in our town,  I needed to relocate. To my surprise,  every company was willing to employ me into their company.</p>

<p>As a loyal and punctual worker,  I have helped to increase the productivity of my company by 15%. How?  I always encourage my team to give their all and also to learn new technology to bootstrap our projects. Also we always try to finish our projects on time.</p>

<p>75% of programmers I have met used to say am a promising and talented programmer. Do you know why?  I am consistent,  dynamic,  team player and innovative.  I try to break complex code into simple structures. I try to be more efficient in a few programming language than learning many programming languages.</p>

  <h2>Consider supporting Monica Cellio's gofundme <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/stop-stack-overflow-from-defaming-its-users"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here >>></a></h2>
  
  <p>A popular and well-respected volunteer network moderator, Monica
  Cellio, <a href=""https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193"">was terminated without warning</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334133"">portrayed to the
  press as misgendering trans people</a> by Stack Overflow, Inc. All
  signs suggest this was an erroneous, if not malicious, decision not
  founded on fact, which the company is completely failing to take any
  responsibility for. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965"">This has caused an enormous and ongoing uproar in
  the community.</a></p>
  
  <p>Monica and the community have been quite literally <strong>begging</strong> for
  <em>some</em> kind of response from the company either opening up a path to reinstatement, or justifying their decision to terminate her, for more
  than a month now. She's made many good-faith offers to talk, and
  others have offered to mediate (and made <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=monica"">dozens of constructive
  suggestions on how to resolve the situation</a>). Several members of the
  Lavender community have spoken up on her behalf, e.g. in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731"">this prominent post</a>.</p>
  
  <p>So far, Stack Overflow, Inc. has met all of this with thunderous
  silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see
  the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good
  faith, I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate
  callousness of this behaviour which we have to assume now is the new
  normal.</p>
  
  <p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526"">Having exhausted all other means of communication,</a> Monica is now
  raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name. This is in
  her own interest, but arguably also in the interest of the SO
  community at large. While only the libel is likely to be legally
  actionable, it might establish at least <em>some</em> boundaries to what the
  company can do to its volunteers, as well as be a symbolic slap in the
  face of a business that appears to have lost all respect for the
  community that keeps it alive.</p>
  
  <p>I have complete trust the funds will be used well and anything left
  over (say because they decide to do the right thing after all and
  legal action becomes unnecessary) will go toward good causes. </p>
  
  <p><strong><a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/stop-stack-overflow-from-defaming-its-users"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Consider supporting her today.</a></strong></p>

His current research interests revolve around, but not limited to, developing robust frameworks for adapting existing NLP models and techniques for low resource language research. He is particularly interested in such meaning abstractions and semantic relationships as captured by deep embedding models often trained with huge amounts of data from highly resourced languages and how to project same to low resource languages. He is also generally interested in the design and development of machine learning and deep neural models as well as their applications to, not just NLP, but to the broader field of data science. Ignatius is currently looking at efficient methods to improving the accuracy and reliability of the Welsh Semantic Tagger.</p>

<h2>Main interests</h2>

<p>I really like programming and developing stuff. My main focus in web application development and testing. Among the technologies I am passionate about, you can find: <em>ASP.NET</em>, <em>.NET</em>, <em>C#</em>, <em>VB.NET</em>, <em>WCF</em>, <em>C/C++</em> (all hail Bjarne), <em>Boost C++ Library</em>, <em>Java</em>, <em>Javascript</em> + dialects (<em>Typescript</em>, etc.), <em>HTML5</em>, CSS + dialects (<em>SASS</em>, <em>LESS</em>, etc.).</p>

<p>I have a lot of interests in Mathematics as well. Among engineering technologies, I really like working with: <a href=""http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wolfram Mathematica</a>, Wolfram Language, <a href=""http://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Matlab</a>.</p>

<p>I also like creating graphics, animations and presentation using the most popular applications in the <em>Adobe</em> families (I saw <em>Flash</em> growing since when it was still a baby, 5.0, and it was still <em>Macromedia</em>, RIP).</p>

<h2>(Human) Languages</h2>

<p>I like travelling a lot, and the best part of travelling is experiencing new languages, new sounds new people and culture. I actually love Asia. I lived in Japan and worked there. Made also a lot of friends and gonna return there soon (I hope). I can speak Italian, English, Japanese and still learning this fancy language called Danish.</p>

<h2>Sports</h2>

<p>I also like sports. I practiced many but now I almost focused my entire life on <strong>swimming</strong> and <strong>open water swimming</strong>. Now I made a full transition to <strong>diving</strong> (no <em>scuba</em>!).</p>

<h2>Other</h2>

<p>I also like photography, reading lots of books, food (strange food) and music. But most of all I like sharing knowledge with other people. More knowledge in the world means a better world! That's why I am #SOreadytohelp!</p>

241137,631,2019-03-14 14:28:51,Vincent Granville,2019-12-01 05:22:24,http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profile/VincentGranville,"Seattle, WA, United States","<p>Well rounded, visionary data science executive with broad spectrum of domain expertise, technical knowledge, and proven success in bringing measurable added value to companies ranging from startups to fortune 100, across multiple industries (finance, Internet, media, IT, security), domains (data science, operations research, machine learning, computer science, business intelligence, statistics, applied mathematics, growth hacking, IoT) and roles (data scientist, founder, CFO, CEO, HR, product development, marketing, media buyer, operations, management consulting).</p>

<p>Vincent developed and deployed new techniques such as hidden decision trees (for scoring and fraud detection), automated tagging, indexing and clustering of large document repositories, black-box, scalable, simple, noise-resistant regression known as the Jackknife Regression (fit for black-box, real-time or automated data processing), model-free confidence intervals, bucketisation, combinatorial feature selection algorithms, detecting causation not correlations, automated exploratory data analysis with data dictionaries, data videos as a visualization tool, automated data science, and generally speaking, the invention of a set of consistent robust statistical / machine learning techniques that can be understood, implemented, interpreted, leveraged and fine-tuned by the non-expert. Vincent also invented many synthetic metrics (for instance, predictive power and L1 goodness-of-fit) that work better than old-fashioned stats, especially on badly-behaved sparse big data. Some of these techniques have been implemented in a Map-Reduce Hadoop-like environment. Some are concerned with identifying true signal in an ocean of noisy data.</p>

<p>Vincent is a former post-doctorate of Cambridge University and the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. He was among the finalists at the Wharton School Business Plan Competition and at the Belgian Mathematical Olympiads. Vincent has published 40 papers in statistical journals (including Journal of Number Theory, IEEE Pattern analysis and Machine Intelligence, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B), a Wiley book on data science, and is an invited speaker at international conferences. He also holds a few patents on scoring technology, and raised $6 MM in VC funding for his first startup. Vincent also created the first IoT platform to automate growth and content generation for digital publishers, using a system of API's for machine-to-machine communications, involving Hootsuite, Twitter, and Google Analytics.</p>

<p>Vincent's profile is accessible <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and includes top publications, presentations, and work experience with Visa, Microsoft, eBay, NBC, Wells Fargo, and other organisations.</p>

All posts are my own opinions, and do not reflect the views of my employer.</p>

<p>I'm available, in a volunteering capacity, to support education events around the Cambridge area, provided these are STEM focused, and involve specific technical activities or relate to 'typical careers and working conditions' in engineering and technology.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about writing a series of blog posts centred around the 'Performing Engineering Operations Level 2' NVQ qualification. There doesn't seem to be much good source material, the teaching (of assessed knowledge) is poor, and the questions asked for assessment have no real answers at all.</p>

<p>I'm also desperate to drag the pre-university teaching of electronics and computing way from 1970's hardware examples. I see students today learning with NE555, and 7805 - these components are as old as me, and are much less likely to be the correct choice. There are questions about pre-forming components - components are, in the main, now designed for automated pick-and-place, not wire-wrap and hand assembly.</p>

<p>I'm a researcher in satellite remote sensing at the Deutscher Wetterdienst in Offenbach, Hessen, Germany.

As my network profile will show, I'm interested in travel, outdoor, scientific skepticism, and as my work is related to academia, also in academia and LaTeX.</p>

I have a great job where I can freely explore and learn from programming to chemistry, physics, marketing, history... I'm a long shot from being a polymath. I'm a jack of all trades, specialized in nothing :)</p>

<p>Thus, the internet, IMHO only seconded by the invention of writing as best thing ever, is extra awesome for someone like me.</p>

<p>That free time is reduced to very little since I'm almost using it all. I'm the co-founder and CEO of a non-profit biotech doing clinical research in neuroscience. Weird combination; tell me about it.
I'm also co-founder and CEO of a small game dev company. This is very recent so the first game is under development :D</p>

<p>I try to give back through (very little) writing in my blog: <a href=""http://hadtobreakit.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hadtobreakit.com</a>, asking and answering here in StackExchange, helping directly other developers/sysadmins, contributing to some open source projects, mentoring people in startups and finally I'm in one of those sites where I can loan money for free to entrepreneurs and students in underdeveloped countries.</p>

<p>Support the <a href=""https://www.fftfef.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">free</a> <a href=""https://www.fightforthefuture.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">internet</a> of the future. Read it, share it, be aware.</p>

When the going gets rough, and when the technological requirements seem impossible, I'm the guy going in, figuring it out, and making it happen. Moreover, I hope that I serve as a good example for what others should do when faced with minimal resources, zero-time, and pressure from every direction.</p>

<p>Outside of the office, I'm a regular science geek: I study, experiment, and have fun with my friends. My core interests &amp; expertise are robotics, scientific programming, AI &amp; ML, and the deeper nuances of embedded systems engineering and development. My colleagues consider me as an expert with C++ &amp; Python, high-performance computing, computer &amp; software architecture, automated build &amp; testing systems, debugging, optimization, and analysis. So, to maintain those areas of expertise, I regularly dabble, tinker, and experiment with a wide array of techniques in those areas.</p>

<p>Over the next year (2019-2020), I aim to build up a serious side-project with some close friends. At the same time, I've begun working towards my Master's degree. At this point in my career, I consider much of what I do like art:</p>

At this point, my focus is studying to get into the insanely competitive CS major program at the university, but eventually, I would love to get a master's in AI. I'm fascinated by biology, CSE, calculus, and philosophy, and my life goal is to help as many people as possible, so artificial intelligence seems like a perfect option for me. My favorite hobbies are wandering Seattle with friends, meeting new people, hugging my dog, and making very odd knitted creations.</p>

<p>PLEASE message me if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have tips for getting into CS</li>
<li>Want to chat with someone about ethics/philosophy</li>
<li>Love dogs</li>
<li>Found a cool article about CS or AI</li>
<li>Just have general suggestions for me, as far as reaching my goals</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a good day!</p>

I also defined a sequent calculus for dynamic topological logic, wrote a computational chemistry paper introducing the notion of Benzene aromarings, am collaborating with physicists on a black hole physics paper, and am founding a photovoltaic systems engineering company ""SolarCube"". I am also currently writing a book on the Geometric Analysis of Convex Bodies which studies the theory of rectification, the connection between elliptic curves and lattice packings, non-congruent sphere packing kissing numbers, homothetic translative covering problems, totally separable sphere packings, and the Mahler conjecture. I recently received a grant to research Applied Discrete Geometry (crystallography of solid state battery electrolytes) in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Calgary and am starting a Masters degree in the fall under the supervision of Karoly Bezdek and Clifton Cunningham.</p>

<p>I like to spend time in nature, and doing exercise outside (Hiking for example). I consider myself as a disciplined, curious, listener and avid learner type person.</p>

<p>Since I discovered functional programming I have been using it and learning it. Particularly I enjoy developing in Scala, although I wouldn't mind to learn some day Haskell. I would like to become an expert in Functional Programming.</p>

<p>I also love Machine Learning and Data Science, and for me, Functional Programing and Machine Learning are the perfect combination. That is the reason why my target job is to become a Machine Learning Engineer. Ideally on a company that actively works on doing social good / Environmental services or AI safety.</p>

<p>My first experience as Machine Learning Engineer was when I became an Undergraduate Machine Learning Researcher at University of Granada. There, I developed an Apache Flink Library for Data Preprocesing using Scala. I adapted six preprocessing algorithms to work on a distributed environment and improved the baseline performance.

<p>Programming languages: </p>

<ul>
<li>Python - this is where all the <strong>magic</strong> at</li>
<li>Bash, Javascript</li>
</ul>

<p>DBs:</p>

<ul>
<li>MySQL - query on a non-indexed column </li>
<li>Redis, MongoDB, DynamoDB</li>
</ul>

<p>Platforms</p>

<ul>
<li>AWS - when all the piping is already done</li>
<li>Linux, Docker</li>
</ul>

<p>Frameworks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flask</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>scikit-learn - it's AI in the slides, but sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression in the code</li>
</ul>

<p>Methodologies:</p>

<ul>
<li>CI/CD - sleepless nights after release, not even once</li>
<li>Domain-Driven Design, Test-Driven Development, Agile</li>
</ul>

<p>My strengths lie within Python. I was lucky to join a team that hosts on AWS, so I had to learn it quickly. And now I'm capable of designing cloud-first software. I have also had a lot of hands-on experience in recent years and have a proven track of successful high-load, scalable projects.</p>

<p>In my free time, I code and write a blog at <a href=""https://smirnov-am.github.io"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://smirnov-am.github.io</a> where I explore technical areas outside day-to-day job.</p>

<p>I like exploring different fields to see what problems haven't been solved, and to gain a better understanding of what we have accomplished so far (as well as appreciate). </p>

<p>Currently working on a computer vision related app (slowly), exploring neural networks, trying to improve my programming skills from a scripter to a better scripter, learning about genetics, synthetic biology, and biohacking, anti-aging and always trying to improve my well-being. </p>

<p>For those that have been programmers for a long time, I would love to hear how much exercise you guys do to stay healthy. Do you take breaks every x minutes? 1hr a day of weights and cardio?  </p>

I have a particular interest in using machine learning to generate business intelligence solutions.</p>

<p>My educational background is a Master's degree in Economics from University College Cork, Ireland.</p>

<p>I have worked with a variety of clients in devising business solutions with machine learning techniques, and have presented my work at international conferences.</p>

<h3>Portfolio projects include:</h3>

<p><a href=""https://www.michael-grogan.com/hotel-cancellations/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hotel Cancellation Analysis with Support Vector Machines, SARIMA, And LSTM Networks</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Used pandas to process, sort, and aggregate over 79,000 booking entries by total cancellations per week.</li>
<li>Implemented machine learning workflow using Amazon SageMaker – used Git to commit relevant repository.</li>
<li>Used scikit-learn to implement ExtraTreesClassifier for feature selection and SVM for classification. Identified lead time, deposit type and country of origin as cancellation drivers. Achieved AUC of 0.74 on the test set.</li>
<li>Devised LSTM model with TensorFlow 2.0 to predict weekly cancellations. Model showed improvement in RMSE from 57.95 (SARIMA performance) to 31.98 (LSTM performance).</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://www.michael-grogan.com/image-recognition-with-keras-convolutional-neural-networks/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Image Recognition with Keras: Convolutional Neural Networks</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Built classifier to distinguish between images of cars and planes. Used training and validation data of 200 images.</li>
<li>Implemented data augmentation with VGG16 pretrained network to prevent overfitting and trained model across 30 epochs. Validation loss significantly reduced from 0.9405 to 0.2567.</li>
<li>Model correctly categorized 93% of test images.</li>

My focus is on the psychopharmacology of addiction and motivation with an emphasis on how early-life environment affects drug-related outcomes in adulthood. I deal primarily with alcohol and amphetamines in animal models of addiction but have done research with humans with marijuana, and nicotine. I deal with a lot of count data, operant data as well as western blots relatively frequently. I also do some Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling. </p>

<p><strong>One of my many missions</strong>: I am trying to get behavioral neuroscience to move towards more judicious use of statistics to look at direction AND magnitude, as opposed to just direction... ""<em>How much more</em> behavior was present across time? what was the <em>functional relationship?</em> If we know the dose-response function looks a certain way, why not use a model other than an ANOVA to look at it with a higher degree of accuracy?"" are questions I often find myself asking.</p>

My main research field is in text analysis and especially text complexity and readability. My background before the PhD program is a MSc in Computer Science and a semester each of political science and sociology.</p>

<p>I consider myself a Bayesian, but not a very dogmatic one, as well as a novice statistician and data scientist. My interests lie in Bayesian approaches to machine learning, and statistics in general, but I'm also moving towards working with Neural Networks and Deep Learning models. My knowledge base is more practical than theoretical though and that is one reason I'm here, to deepen my theoretical understanding by asking questions and trying to help others where possible. I am also very interested in cognitive science in general.</p>

<p>I also consider myself a rationalist, a two-level utilitarian and an anti-dogmatic libertarian socialist. While these labels are probably irrelevant here I find it helps transparency to declare any possible biases up front.</p>

<ul>
<li>Quality        - for dissemination by UN agencies for example</li>
<li>BI             - Dashboards for adaptive management and Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (M&amp;E)</li>
<li>Visualizations - for oooohing and aaaahing and hopefully sparking interest</li>
<li>Strategy       - data/asset management because domain experts frequently suck at data</li>
<li>Guru-to-IT     - I'm a fairly good at translating between domain experts and IT people</li>
</ul>

<p>I also like to play with R for fun stuff like music, movies, art, meta-analysis, love, etc. Check my blog.</p>

<p>My long-term research focuses on numerical cosmological relativity as an approach to solve the backreaction conjecture. Because general relativity is one of the most beautiful and profund theory in physics. Because is it not a simple problem and because simple problems are boring. And because it raises fundamental questions in philosophy, physics and computer science. As a consequence my day-to-day research is currently oriented towards fundamental problems in high performance computing, data science and programming languages.</p>

<p>Because fundamental research often leads to genericity, the abovementioned research has direct applications in a wide range of domains. The bit manipulation algorithms I originally developed to speed up tree data structures in physics simulations are now under review by the C++ Standardization Committee to be integrated to the next version of the C++ language, with applications in bioinformatics, climate science, number theory and neural networks.</p>

<p>One day Chopin said ""Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast quantity of notes and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art."" and I really thinks that the same applies to research and code development. </p>

My personal work is in the domain of Bayesian Latent variable modeling. I teach linear regression courses, and am well versed in general behavioral research methods such as: linear modeling, multi-level modeling, latent variable approaches, longitudinal methods, clustering methods, principal component methods, and Bayesian approaches. My language of choice is R and have been teaching and using R for 6 years. I prefer STAN for Bayesian models, but am familiar with Jags and Bugs. I also have experience with supervised machine learning algorithms like LEM2, and unsupervised methods like cluster analysis. My research method of choice is simulation studies (monte-carlo) and frequently answer my own questions by writing simulations in R.</p>

My goal in my life is to come up with an algorithm that solves the Artificial General Intelligence problem (there is a bit of obscurity in the actual definition of this term. Here I refer to the actual Human-like intelligence). I believe that AGI can be solved (without requiring extreme computation power. I.e., with the average computation power we have today) by searching for the solution a little different than it is usually done. </p>

<p>I believe, the best way to know About-me is to look at my code: </p>

<p>My github links: <a href=""https://github.com/Aplokodika"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/Aplokodika</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/sreramk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/sreramk</a></p>

<h2>The biggest problem I face when thinking about AGI</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The hardest part about trying solve AGI is, thinking about the human
  brain's functioning is a bit too frustrating, and exploring any
  potential end-point makes us feel that there could be no answer to
  this problem. I would describe the human brain as a ""super recursive
  machine"" that let's us think about thinking, and above all, every part
  of it is too interconnected and dynamic that one isolated piece of
  information in one isolated area could be responsible for altering
  another piece of information in a completely different area/domain.
  Also, it is a complicated equilibrium system, where every part of it
  is responsible for maintaining a persistent experience. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>My say on AGI:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most methods formulated today are highly optimized for pattern
  matching, at an abstract scale. Any complex corpus of information can
  be classified by taking their most common pattern, as a representation
  of a particular class. Therefore, every piece of data that contains
  that pattern is referred to by a class name. These ""unsupervised
  learning"" mechanisms which fine-tune it's pattern classification comes
  furthest in solving the problem, when compared to all the other known
  algorithms. </p>
  
  <p>Eg., Works like Alpha Go, rely on ""rebuilding"" their assertion to
  different situations by relying both on a unsupervised algorithm that
  stores associated rewards to each situations (which are represented as
  abstract patterns in a DNN), and use that knowledge to explore the
  solution space more efficiently. This mechanism is also Turing
  complete.   </p>
  
  <p>I believe, all these methods are still only optimized for solving
  problems that involve pattern matching. But AGI is further than just
  pattern matching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm still in college, doing my BE computer science degree. I have started implementing my algorithm, and I'm putting in all my effort (free time) in trying to finish it. I'm building this algorithm from scratch, in C++, and later I would use Cython to bring it into the Python world. <em>I hope it works, if it doesn't, oh well... I'll cook up a newer hypothesis to try and implement that!</em>.</p>

<li>Surfer hat; </li>
<li>This new thing must be interested hat; </li>

Python, JS and Unix.</p>

For my thesis, I am working on the neurobiological and neuropsychological underpinnings of memory consolidation during sleep and how these processes might be disturbed for reward learning in addiction.</p>

<p>When I got to know <code>R</code> during my masters in psychology, I fell head over heels for it, especially how it brought me the stats education that lectures wouldn't provide. Right now, I am trying to broaden my statistical horizon because there is so much more I need to know. For my PhD, handling EEG data is vital, i.e. time-frequency analyses, cluster-based approaches etc.</p>

<p>I am also interested in simulations (in order to understand and test statistical approaches), in wich cases non-normal data is a problem and what to do about it and how to properly implement and interpret random effects.</p>

Before I started the bachelor, I was able to program my calculator. During my bachelor, I mainly learned working with Haskell, Prolog, Java, LaTeX, UML, SQL and VHDL. Next to these major languages, I also got to see some C#, python, matlab, R, php and shell script. Now, through my master I'm just learning more and more about the languages. I got in touch with assembly and C, got a taste of smalltalk and learned several new things about things I thought I knew. Further on I have a big piece of learning on the agenda this year. During the semester break, I decided to learn some HTML and CSS in order to help some relatives and to stay warm for what's yet to come.</p>

<p>Throughout my education (thus far) I realised that I won't ever master a language completely, but I did learn that good design might be as important as knowing the language. </p>

<p>Concretely, this means </p>

<ul>
<li>I mostly program in Java, because I was taught to do so</li>
<li>I like to work with LaTeX rather than word or any of its kind (for some unexplainable reason?)</li>
<li>I am fascinated by functional programming (and in particular Haskell) since I read <a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a></li>
<li>I need a terminal on my computer</li>
<li>I still have a lot of work to do</li>
</ul>

<p>PS: I like maths and physics quite a lot too, I hope this does not cause too much problems in the future...</p>

<p>If I see further than most, it is because I have stood on the toes of giants and they kicked me high into the air...</p>

<p>However, there is nothing to suggest that I see further than most.</p>

<p>I am (inasmuch as one 'is' an occupation) an engineer. My mathematical skills are rather pedestrian, with a rare insight every now and then. I have been lucky enough to sit in the same room with some famous mathematicians &amp; engineers. My Erdős number is 5, which undoubtedly makes me as unique as an Irishman in a pub. And I have been spotted in The Pub from time to time.</p>

<p>In professional circumstances, my value add has usually been the injection of common sense and completion of grunt work when perspectives and energies are unfocused. </p>

<p>My current age is the largest prime less than the number of atoms in Buckminsterfullerene.</p>

<p>My real name is Joe Higgins. Apparently, my last name means 'of the Viking' in Irish. </p>

<p>My alma mater is University College, Cork in Ireland, and I had the additional privilege of obtaining my Phd. in EECS from the University of California at Berkeley under the enlightened tutelage of Lucien Polak.</p>

<p>I can be reached at joe dot higgins at gmail dot com.</p>

<p>The little picture is of my tent at Lake Helen on the beautiful Mount Shasta in August, 2009. Unfortunately I had to turn back near the peak this time (on the appropriately named Misery Hill) because of a lightning storm which dumped some
unexpected snow. The nearby lightning caused my ice axe to hum and a strange bee-like
buzzing sound in my hair! Very entertaining.</p>

<p>Feynman used to say, ""physics is to sex as mathematics is to masturbation"".</p>

<p>To cheer you up, AE Housman wrote that 
    ""Perfect understanding will sometimes almost extinguish pleasure.""</p>

<p>I like Rockafellar's line: ""This classical result is an outstanding example of a fact which is completely obvious to geometric intuition, but which wields important algebraic content and is not trivial to prove."" (""Convex Analysis"", commentary before Theorem 19.1.)</p>

<p>About me: I studied Geography an fell in love with R and Data Science in my first job as market researcher. Today I mainly work with <strong>R-Shiny</strong> and develop apps or scripts to make my work easier for my dear colleagues. </p>

<p>Besides R I like to work with the common web technologies HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>I love to solve tricky problems of all kinds and hope to be able to help one or the other with a problem :-)</p>

Then, inspired by the idea of users' collaborated design in future Internet of things platforms, I switched my track into System Engineering. During the time at Stevens, I have been working on Socio-technical networks and multi-sided platforms. Meanwhile, I had the opportunity to catch up with the state-of-the-art projects on Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and cloud services in New York.</p>

<p>In 2017, I have attended a summer school at Harvard University on ""Computational Social Cognition"" and NSF sponsored boot camp at Clemson University on ""Systems Design"". In Fall 2017, I won a Fellowship by Innovation and Entrepreneurship center at Stevens to work on Multi-sided socio-technical platforms. I am eager to join a company in field of AI as a creative promoter. </p>

<p>Before that, I have been working as a coordinator and teacher of Math Olympiad courses and published several books and online courses once I was in Iran.</p>

261340,11,2019-10-01 03:08:46,Earlien - reinstate Monica,2019-11-30 08:01:50,,Australia,"<p>A popular and well-respected volunteer network moderator, Monica Cellio, was terminated without warning and portrayed to the press as misgendering trans people by Stack Overflow, Inc. All signs suggest this was an erroneous, if not malicious, decision not founded on fact, which the company is completely failing to take any responsibility for. This has caused an enormous and ongoing uproar in the community.</p>

<p>Monica and the community have been quite literally begging for some kind of response from the company either opening up a path to reinstatement, or justifying their decision to terminate her, for more than a month now. She's made many good-faith offers to talk, and others have offered to mediate (and made dozens of constructive suggestions on how to resolve the situation). Members of the LGBT... community have spoken up on her behalf.</p>

<p>So far, Stack Overflow, Inc. has met all of this with thunderous silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good faith, I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate callousness of this behaviour which we have to assume now is the new normal.</p>

<p>Having exhausted all other means of communication, Monica is now raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name. This is in her own interest, but arguably also in the interest of the SO community at large. While only the libel is likely to be legally actionable, it might establish at least some boundaries to what the company can do to its volunteers, as well as be a symbolic slap in the face of a business that appears to have lost all respect for the community that keeps it alive.</p>

My thesis was about the MicroMEGAS detector where I constructed, studied, simulated and analysed data. I have enrolled(October 2012) in a M.Sc. programm called Physics and Technological Applications (NTUA) and I hope to continue with a Ph.D.</p>

<p>My working experience includes 7 years student's tutoring(university,high school, primary school), 1 year of developing laser systems on behalf of the NTUA Laser Group, 1 year of detector studies on behalf of the NTUA High Energy Physics Group(HEP-NTUA) and a month working at CERN on behalf of the RD51 collaboration, in detector RnD.</p>

<p>My future plans include Ph.D studies in the USA or Europe in the field of experimental Physics(I should decide on which particular field), marrying my girlfriend and working in research.</p>

<p>Other interests include culinary, pastry, photography, basketball, cinema, completing tutorial in various fields and computing.</p>

As far as languages go my true love is python (with django if the project has significant backend requirements). That said, after 20 years of random occasional programming gigs I have made my peace with most other non MS languages (Perl excepted!). I'm happiest on linux but, having done a LOT of  support work in heterogeneous environments I can find my way round Mac &amp; PC's pretty well too.</p>

<p>Right now, and largely owing to the recent upsurge in platform heterogeneity, I am heavily focussed on client side stuff in javascript/HTML5. It is proving to be a refreshing change from the mostly server side stuff I've done for ever. I'm still some way off loving it as a language but ES6 was a decent improvement which bodes well for the future. I've long dreamed of having a unified language for client and server, sadly it seems that will never be python so maybe in the fullness of time I'll go native and start doing my backends in node.js (node.js people all love coffeescript right!? ;)</p>

<p>I'm not really a gun for hire again til 2018/2019 but I want to keep my skills fresh and one should never say never.

I have already practised the profession of musician, always alongside the studies. At the moment I'm more focused on my work and only dedicate myself to music in my free time.</p>

<p>Informatics is another area that gives me real interest and, for this reason, I chose the Master of Informatics Engineering from FEUP. Within informatic, I have a particular interest in computer graphics, game development, virtual and augmented reality, robotics and distributed systems. However, there is no informatics strand that I didn't like, until now.</p>

<p>I am also a sportsman, and I practice various sports whenever I can, such as all-terrain bike, running, gym, football, among others.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I have a great passion for photography, so I am an amateur photographer.</p>

He spent too many years writing software <em>just</em> for fun on the side while working retail to pay the bills. </p>

<p>Martin picked up professional experience working as a private contractor for Nocturnal Entertainment Australia on the Game Boy Advance title Ultimate Arcade Games. With a shiped title under his belt he attempted to move into a full time position in the industry but ultimately fell short. 
Disappointed, Martin decided to return to school to flesh out his skill set. In the process he discovered he enjoyed the problem solving and design of complex systems more than the game development. He graduated at(or nearly so) the top of his class at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a degree in Computer Engineering. </p>

<p>Today he works on the Enterprise Management Technologies team at Quad/Graphics.</p>

<p>My wife and I enjoy travelling, drinking different types of beer and hanging out with friends in pubs or at home. We love animals and to walk near the beach on the weekend.</p>

<p>I’m a software developer with over 6 years of experience, working with different technologies, environments and languages, but mostly with the .NET stack. I have been using Angular as a frontend framework, and AWS/Azure to host decoupled and scalable microservices using Service Bus and Serverless. I also managed to implement a DevOps pipeline on top of Azure in one of the companies I worked at, using on-premises servers to build and deploy.</p>

<p>I’m currently learning and working on personal projects using Vue.js, Node.js + MongoDB and Machine Learning. I am passionate about artificial intelligence and how it can impact people lives around the world. I managed to finish the Machine Learning course by Stanford University (on Coursera), and I’ve been working with Jupyter + Python building some models using data from Kaggle. I also want to learn React and Deep Learning.</p>

<p>I have been an active Stack Overflow member for the last years, in which I spend some of my free time answering, editing, flagging and reading interesting QAs. I think it's a good way to learn and exchange knowledge. I also like coding when I'm learning from platforms such as Pluralsight and playing around with AWS or Azure. I think there is always something to learn.</p>

<p>3.) What is a probabilistic justification for bootstrapping an estimate. Why/when does it match the posterior distribution of an estimate? Does this mean bootstrapping is getting the distribution of the estimate conditioned on the data observations?</p>

<p>4.) There are an infinite number of ways to create a variable. So what does the NUCA really mean?  If I observe state, but I do not observe city? If I observe the last year, but not the last month.  Time and Space can be cut into an uncountable number of covariates. What if I have grue and bleen, as opposed to blue and green? And Jerry Fodor's work on mapping the tokens of laws between special sciences. He shows this is not one to one.  Then is no unobserved confounders the union of all of those tokens?</p>

<p>5.) How do you assess if you have the right amount of common support to use inverse probability weighting?</p>

<p>6.) What bias does the confounding adjustment formula fix? What are causal inference methods for other kinds of bias? Selection bias, etc.</p>

<p>7.) Does a power analysis need to be done differently for confounded data? How does common support play into a power analysis when TE is confounded?</p>

<p>8.) Is there a way to generalize grid search to estimate a posterior, instead of MCMC? What assumptions would you have to make? Is there a way to capture those assumptions?</p>

<p>10.) Is the Bunzl argument for frequentism that the prior distribution is conditioned on prior data? And if so, what is the weight of that prior data? Why do we treat it like a single observation? If I have a study that says theta=2 based on 1000 samples, shouldn't my prior hold the weight of 1000 samples?</p>

<p>11.) Can a DAG really represent the causal structure of elements measured within a time window? What assumptions are being made about the measurement and the time point it represents?  Just because I measure something now, doesn't mean that value came about at the time of measurement.  I wonder if there is a counter example where P(M|data) is a collider, even though the actual generating model is not a collider.</p>

<p>12.) Can we use sums/averages/medians or other summary statistics in DAGs?</p>

<p>13.) Can you learn the missingness graph by occams razor?</p>

<p>16.) Keep track of the evidence SUM(e^-bic) and somehow use this as the MCMC develops</p>

<p>17.) What is the dependence of two counterfactual random variables?</p>

<p>18.) Is there a identifiable criterion to know if a probability marginalization is analytically tractable?  Is there a identifiable criterion to know if there is an obvious envelope distribution of a distribution of interest, in order to apply a rejection sampler?</p>

<p>19.) What exactly is a dedekind cut? Is the continuum hypothesis a matter of memory in sets? What if that set of all subsets of N is reduced by some form of memory adjustment(only the last n elements)?</p>

If math was a real person I would be the first person in line to kill him/her/it. I've gone back to school in order to upgrade several of my high school marks. Chemistry and Biology weren’t to bad, but I'm somewhat struggling with math. Hopefully the community can help and guide me for the rest of the term. Looking forward to learning from all of you :)</p>

<p>Hmmm…what else can I say about myself. Well, I love baking and I used to be a bookworm, but in the last couple of years I’ve stopped reading as life took over. Ok, I lied it’s not life it’s that my other unimportant hobbies took over. I love Asian history and art and have been doing research on my own time. I don’t watch western shows anymore, and have completely become obsessed with Asian dramas, mainly from China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, and Taiwan. If you happen to be a member on MDL please look me up as I’m always there. I’ll end it here as I don’t want to go on and on about myself.</p>

I’m a technologist, husband, father and soccer coach.  I work out of the Ann Arbor office for the technology team at ProModel.</p>

<p>During the past 12 years, I have been involved in several ProModel divisions, including onsite support, consulting, product development, sales, support and training. In 2002, I was promoted to Director of New Products, with the responsibility of running development of new products at ProModel.</p>

<p>Prior to my role as Director of New Products, I founded CadreSoft Corporation in 1999.  CadreSoft embedded ProModel technology which I feel innovated new approaches to solving capacity problems through discrete event simulation.</p>

<p>In 2007 I was named CTO, assuming full management responsibility for delivering on the company’s mission of enterprise decision modeling through predictive simulation solutions.  I think a summary would be, I have a true passion for creating software that drives strategic decision-making.
I grew up near Detroit, where my father worked at General Motors. I have a B.S. in Industrial Engineering from Western Michigan University.  I have an incredible family that I love spending time with.</p>

<p>Some other things about me you might find interesting.
I have a lefty Simian Line.
I collect pictures of people shoes they cut the grass with.  See them in the Shed.
My genealogy research suggests my surname is not Hickman.
I am a soccer coach for my son’s Ninja team and my daughter’s Gator team.</p>

I previously received my PhD in Developmental Psychology at the University of Connecticut. There I primarily worked in the Language Creation Lab under the mentorship of Marie Coppola, and in the SoLab under Whit Tabor. I was also a fellow in the Language Plasticity -- Genes, Brain, Cognition, &amp; Computation IGERT (which is now the Neurobiology of Language program), and an affiliate of the CT Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences.</p>

<p>My interests include cognitive science in general, and language in particular. At the moment (July 22, 2019, 12:58PM), most of my recent work concerns (a) semantic representations of words (and sometimes sentences) obtained through psychometric or natural language processing techniques, and (b) the judgments and decisions people make based on those representations. Previously, I've been interested in questions about how people represent and process prosodic information, as well as questions about the emergence of language and particularly conventional referring expressions (what we might roughly call 'the lexicon'). Over the years, my research has involved natural language processing, computational modeling, and behavioral studies in the lab, the field, and online.</p>

From managing a climbing world championship to being Director for a leading aerial rigging (special effects) company in India.  
My travels to more than 13 countries and my passion for rock climbing has immensely shaped my perspective towards setbacks and successes. As a yoga practitioner I am always striving to achieve work life balance. Working with people in teams and often being in leadership role has sharpened my skills as a professional and as a patient human being. </p>

<p>My technical knowledge in computers and data analysis is aimed at solving business problems and improving efficiency at work for any given business set up. I am skilled at inferring valuable insights to make important business decisions.</p>

<p> I'm a tenacious problem solver and I persevere to take the tasks at hand to the logical end. With my track record, I'm confident that I'm ready to make an immediate impact. I am eager to get started, and I would welcome the chance to discuss the next steps when we meet in person.</p>

<p>I am focusing on studying data mining, as to build a base for more advanced topics in data science later on. Never neglect the fundamentals because: A house without proper structure will collapse.</p>

<p>I do not need a job. I get too many job offers already. Please do not contact me to offer me employment. The exception is if you work for a legitimate charity.</p>

<p>Do not ask me for investment advice (you can ask for other advice, though). It's very rude and not my speciality. The exception is if you work for a legitimate charity.</p>

<p>I used to script almost exclusively in Perl, but a couple of years ago I discovered the wonders of PowerShell, and have since fallen in love with it.</p>

<p>Why am I here? Because I greatly enjoy problem-solving, and I find that I vastly increase my knowledge and well-roundedness by figuring out other people's problems. I started answering questions mainly because I wanted to gain 50 rep points so I could post comments, and, well, as you see on the left I kind of overshot my goal a little bit...okay, I got addicted. I really should see someone about this...</p>

<p>[If you're asking yourself, ""WTF? This all sounds strangely out of context for this site. Is this guy on crack??"", the answer is no. This profile was written for Stack Overflow, but apparently it automatically gets copied when a new account is created at some other Stack Exchange, but not all. I'm not sure why. BTW, if you change the question to ""...is this guy on a mushroom trip??"", then the answer changes to ""Possibly, but that's still not why this profile sounds strangely out of context.""]</p>

I completed my PhD at Wesleyan University in 2014 under the supervision of Mark Hovey, and I completed a masters degree in computer science under the supervision of Danny Krizanc. I'm mostly interested in questions involving (semi) model categories, Bousfield localization, and algebras over (colored) operads. I like to apply my work to unstable, stable, equivariant, and motivic homotopy theory, to homological algebra, and to representation theory. On the computer science side I like thinking about graph theory, probability, and social networks, with an eye towards algorithms. I've also begun to dabble in game theory, economics, and statistics, thanks to my teaching.</p>

<p>For the last several decades, I've thrived on cramming lots of functionality into tiny processors.  One of my specialities is exploiting the properties of single chip devices (e.g. GPIO ports, PWM timers, etc) to create robust designs with minimal parts count.</p>

<hr>

<p>My first startup, Ember Corporation (bought by Silicon Labs) ushered in the Internet of Things by releasing the first microcontrollers with embedded wireless mesh networking.  Long before Ember, I made 6502, Z80 and PIC processors jump through hoops to control laser printers, environmental sensors, audio devices, lighting systems and electronic whoopee cushions.</p>

<p>More recently, I've been working with RPi, various Arduino (including Intel Arduino 101), Freescale/NXP KL2xx, and I look forward creating new things on the ESP32, GR8, AM335x and/or nRF52 family of processors.</p>

<p>My work doesn't stop at the microcontroller level: I use C, C++, Python, Javascript/Node, Ruby and other languages to connect the microcontrollers into cloud-based applications.</p>

it's not there, it has never been there and never will it be.<br></p>

shrieking and dancing faithfully to the frenzy Tango of LIFE,<br>

<hr>

<p>My passion has been delivering though leading, massive scale products that impact people's lives and turning ideas into reality.</p>

<p>Most of my core skills rely on bridging mathematics and technology with business acumen to provide solutions to business problems, create new business opportunities and improve processes and decision making.</p>

<p>I have been fortunate enough to help projects in more than 18 countries (across 4 continents) advising and consulting small business owners and global companies, while managing multidisciplinary teams across distributed locations.</p>

<p>Since I remember I was always actively involved with the community around me, giving back, and for over 10 years my involvement with humanitarian causes has been growing.
Apart from being a blood donor, these past years I had the opportunity to promote, with the help of amazing people, the healthy living in Sierra Leone.
I am grateful to be able to provide, since 2016, computing power to advance cutting-edge scientific researches on topics related to health, poverty, sustainability and others.
My actions demonstrate my belief that real power comes from serving and loving others. </p>
