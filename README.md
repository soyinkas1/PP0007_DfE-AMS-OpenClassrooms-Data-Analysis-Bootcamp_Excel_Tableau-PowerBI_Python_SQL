# PP0007_DfE-AMS-OpenClassrooms-Data-Analysis-Bootcamp_Excel_Tableau-PowerBI_Python_SQL
This is the repository containing for 4 projects undertaken during the 4-months Data Analysis Bootcamp sponsored by the Department for Education UK delivered through OpenClassrooms and managed by Alexander Mann Solutions-AMS

**Project 1 - Explore a Dataset on Energy Usage and Draw Your First Conclusions**

This project is an application of advanced excel skills to analyse a dataset of energy consumption

The analysis is to provide insights into:

What does demand look like over time?
What does extreme demand look like, and under what circumstances does this happen?
How do factors like the weather and holidays affect demand?
It was not required to to predict demand just to show understanding on how it varies.

The deliverables are:
1. A workbook in Excel, Google Sheets, or Numbers.
2. A short slide deck (using PowerPoint or an equivalent tool) addressing the tools and data lifecycle points 

**Project 2 - Create a Dashboard Meeting Business Requirements**

The requirements of the project is to produce a data visualisation dashboard using Tableau or PowerBI for a company with a global presence, and the management wants to standardize the monitoring of various projects within the company to keep track of how projects are doing to measure current and future performance.

The execution for the bootcamp was done by Tableau and available on Tableau Public in the link below. The future personal action would be to create the same dashboard using PowerBI.

The project deliverables are:
1. Dashboard blueprint.
2. mockup of the additional visualizations.
3. A link to the Tableau Public version of the dashboard and additional worksheets, as well as the export of it in PDF or image format. Or provide the PowerBI version of your project (.pbix file) or the Excel document. 
4. A slide show which answers specific questions on the lifecycle and requirements.

**Project 3 - Assess the Quality of a Dataset for a Public Service Agency**

The project required that exploration of three data sets be done to determine their adequacy for the initiatives to be undertaken by a local council authority in the UK.

These are: 
***Public Tree Data***
Provide a list of all trees in the borough, which can be downloaded by the public for free from the Camden Council website. The Borough of Camden is committed to the “opendata” initiative and are interested in opening their data as much as possible to its citizens and to the world.

The deliverables presented are:

***Tree Walks Brochures***
Create a series of “Tree Walks” brochures, each one of which is a guided walk around an individual park showing a map of the location of interesting trees.

The deliverables presented are:

***Environment Report***
Put up a single page on the Camden Council website showing the total carbon and pollution benefit provided by all their trees. This will also show information about trees removed, trees planted and the net carbon and pollution impact of this activity.

The deliverables presented are:

**Project 4 - Retrieve User Activity Data on an Online Forum Using SQL**
The inteaction data from an online forum was analysed using SQL by answering some specific questions about user activity (interaction) on the sites. The datasets were cleaned and formatting into three -users, posts & comments.

Phyton-Sqlite library was ultilised for the project. The queries created was also updated into a database so that it can be reused for future analysis.

The deliverables presented are:
1. The Entity Relationship Diagram.
2. The completed jupyter notebook. 
3. The presentation that covers all of the following items:
>Data analysis lifecycle,
>Requirements,
>Tools,
>Quality,
>Security, ethics and legislation
